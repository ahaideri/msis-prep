## Practice
Rick Watson has a great practice data set you can use.

It's best if you get the practice installing, setting up, and using your own database, but free resources exist as well. (e.g, [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com) and [SQL Playground](https://sql-playground.wizardzines.com))

If you wish to install a database on your local machine (yes!), we recommend [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) or [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) (get the pre-compiled bundles with command line tools).

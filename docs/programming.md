# Programming

You should already be familiar with at least one programming language.

## During the MSIS program
During your time in the MSIS program you will use R, PHP, Javascript and possibly other computer languages. The more languages you learn, the better you will understand how computer languages work, and why different languages use different idioms.

This document encourages you to practice with Python, as that is what a majority of our incoming students studied. However, many of these exercises can be completed in any programming languages.

## Practice apps
Here is a small list of programs or scripts you could write. These can be accomplished as simple command-line applications, or built in a slightly more complex way as web applications. You are encouraged to be comfortable with both methods.

* **Mortgage interest calculator.** Ask the user for an interest rate, loan term, and amount financed. Print out both the interest paid over the life of the loan and total amount the lessee will pay.
* **Unit conversion.** Ask the user for a temperature in Fahrenheit. Print output in Celsius. For a bigger challenge, also ask the user for the input and output units. _This exercise can be repeated using liquid measures (quarts, gallons, liters), weight measures (pounds, kilograms, stone), distance measures (feet, yards, miles, meters), etc._
* **Calculator.** Allow the user to enter a mathematical equation. Output the answer. For greater difficulty, correctly support order of operations (2 + 3 * 4 = 14).
* **Read a file** Given a file with a list of words as input, filter the file to remove duplicates, and return the list sorted alphabetically.
* **TODO list (using a database)** Write a TODO list app. Store future todos and completed items in a database. (Good databases to use for this project include SQLite and MySQL.)
* **Consume a web service.** Write a program that uses a free web service. There are several lists of free web service APIs available online ([like this one](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)). Here are some specific examples:
    - Calculate the distance between two ZIP codes [https://  www.zipcodeapi.com/API](https://www.zipcodeapi.com/API) (Requires free signup for API key)
    - Fetch a random person, and print their name and email address [https://randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me)
    - Return movies details based on a title search. [https://www.omdbapi.com](https://www.omdbapi.com) (Requires free signup for API key)

# Purpose

This project hopes to document the knowledge needed for incoming Masters of Information Systems students.

The intent is to provide self-paced learning which relies primarily on outside resources. In other words, this site should be a _curation_ of existing resources rather than being a primary resource itself.

When building out content, don't simply link to outside resources, provide context and commentary. Connect resources together. Highlight the strengths of a particular resource.

# Modules
This site is (will be) organized into modules. Each module should conclude with a set of project exercises learners could complete to demonstrate content mastery.

# Installing and building mkdocs
Building and testing the site requires Python 3 and [mkdocs][mkdocs]. You may also need to install (via `pip3`) specific markdown extensions.

[mkdocs]:https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#writing-with-markdown

<!-- TODO: complete installation guide -->
_This portion of the guide—installation for authors—needs to be fleshed out further._

## Test
To locally build and test the site, run the following from the command line:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
